	<h2>about</h2>
	<p class="about">Pipilotti (Elisabeth) Rist (born 1962) is a visual artist. She is best known for creating experiential video art and installation art that often portrays <span class="yellow">self-portraits</span> and singing. Her work is often described as surreal, intimate, abstract art, having a preoccupation with the <span class="red">female body</span>. Her artwork is often categorized as feminist art. </p>

	<p class="about02">	In a 2011 Guardian exhibition review article, Rist describes her feminism: "Politically," she says, "I am a <span class="orange">feminist</span>, but personally, I am not. For me, the image of a woman in my <span class="blue">art</span> does not stand just for women: she stands for all humans. I hope a young guy can take just as much from my art as any woman."</p>

	<h3>Life and Career</h3>
	<p class="life">Pipilotti Rist was born Elisabeth Rist in Grabs in the <span class="blue">Rhine Valley</span>. Her father is a doctor and her mother is a teacher. She started going by <span class="red">"Pipilotti"</span>, a combination her childhood nickname "Lotti" with her childhood hero, Astrid Lindgren’s character <span class="green">Pippi Longstocking</span>, in 1982.</p>

	<p class="life02">Prior to studying art and film, Rist studied theoretical physics in Vienna for one semester. From 1982 to 1986 Rist studied <span class="yellow">commercial art</span>, illustration, and photography at the University of Applied Arts Vienna in Vienna. She later studied video at the School of Design (Schule für Gestaltung) in Basel, <span class="red">Switzerland</span>. From 1988 through 1994.</p>

	 <p class="life03">she was member of the music band and performance group <span class="green">Les Reines prochaines</span>. In 1997, her work was first featured in the Venice Biennial, where she was awarded <span class="yellow">the Premio 2000 Prize</span>. From 2002 to 2003, she was invited by <span class="red">Professor Paul McCarthy</span> to teach at UCLA as a visiting faculty member. From Summer 2012 through to Summer 2013, Rist spent a <span class="blue">sabbatical</span> in Somerset.</p>

	<p class="life04">Rist lives in <span class="orange">Zurich</span>, Switzerland with her partner Balz Roth, an entrepreneur. She and Roth have a son, <span class="green">Himalaya</span>.</p>

	<p class="life05">Rist is represented by <span class="blue">Hauser & Wirth</span> alongside other widely known modern and <span class="yellow">contemporary women artists</span> such as Louise Bourgeois, Jenny Holzer, Lorna Simpson, and Eva Hesse.</p>

<p class="life06">	Her first feature <span class="red">film</span>, Pepperminta, had its world premiere at the <span class="blue">66th Venice International Film Festival</span> in 2009.

<h5 class="work">works</h5>
<p class="work01">During her studies Pipilotti Rist began making super <span class="yellow">8 films</span>. Her works generally last only a few minutes, borrowing from mass-media formats such as <span class="blue">MTV</span> and advertising, with alterations in their colors, speed, and sound. Her works generally treat <span class="orange">issues</span> related to gender, sexuality, and the human body.</p>

<p class="work02">Her <span class="green">colorful</span> and musical works transmit a sense of <span class="yellow">happiness</span> and <span class="red">simplicity</span>. Rist's work is regarded as feminist by some art critics. Her works are held by many important art collections <span class="blue">worldwide</span>.</p>

<p class="work03">In I'm Not The Girl Who Misses Much (1986) Rist dances before a camera in a black dress with <span class="orange">uncovered breasts</span>. The images are often monochromatic and fuzzy. Rists repeatedly sings <span class="green">"I'm not the girl who misses much"</span> a reference to the first line of the song "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" by <span class="yellow">the Beatles</span>. As the video approaches its end, the image becomes increasingly blue and fuzzy and the sound stops.</p>

<p class="work04">Rist achieved notoriety with <span class="red">Pickelporno</span> (Pimple porno) (1992), a work about the female body and sexual excitation. The fisheye camera moves over the <span class="blue">bodies</span> of a couple. The images are charged by intense colors, and are simultaneously strange, <span class="blue">sensual</span>, and ambiguous.</p>

<p class="work05">Sip My Ocean (1996), a video projected as a <span class="orange">mirrored reflection</span> on two adjoining walls, shows a dreamlike series of images of a bikini-clad woman swimming <span class="blue">underwater</span> among sinking tea cups, televisions, and other domestic objects. It is accompanied by a soundtrack of Rist singing Chris Isaak’s <span class="yellow">"Wicked Game"</span>, occasionally punctuated by Rist's repeated shrieking of the lyrics “I don’t want to fall in <span class="red">love</span>.”</p>

<p class="work06">Ever is Over All (1997) shows in slow-motion a <span class="orange">young woman</span> walking along a city street, smashing the windows of parked cars with a <span class="green">large hammer in the shape of a tropical flower</span>. At one point a police officer greets her. The audio video installation has been <span class="yellow">purchased</span> by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p>

<p class="work07">Rist's nine video segments titled Open My Glade were played once every <span class="red">hour</span> on a screen at <span class="blue">Times Square</span>Times Square in New York City, a project of the Messages to the <span class="green">Public program</span>, which was founded in 1980.</p>

<p class="work08">Pour Your Body Out was a commissioned <span class="yellow">multimedia installation</span> organized by Klaus Biesenbach and installed in the atrium of the Museum of <span class="green">Modern Art</span> in early 2009. In an interview with Phong Bui published in The Brooklyn Rail, Rist said she chose <span class="red">the atrium</span> for the installation "because it reminds me of a church's interior where you’re constantly reminded that the spirit is good and the body is bad. This <span class="orange">spirit</span> goes up in space but the body remains on the ground. This piece is really about bringing those two differences together."</p>

<h5 class="collection">Collections</h5>
<p class="collection01"> <span class="yellow">Rist's</span> work is held in the permanent collections of museums and galleries including the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. <span class="green">Guggenheim Museum</span>, the San Francisco MoMA, and the <span class="red">Utrecht Centraal Museum</span>.</p>

<h5 class="influ">Influence</h5>
<p class="influ01">Ever is Over All was referenced in 2016 by <span class="yellow">Beyoncé</span> in the film accompanying her album Lemonade in which the singer is seen walking down a city street <span class="red">smashing</span> windows of parked cars with a baseball bat.</p>
